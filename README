1. What is this program for?
----------------------------

The aim of DigitalWallet is to provide a tool with which you can collect all the expenses you make while you can also watch your budget. You should always be able to do this, thats why i chose JME.

Future versions will include a function to export the expenses to a .csv-file (comma-separated values) which can be sent over bluetooth for further processing.
