1. What is this program for?
----------------------------

The aim of DigitalWallet is to provide a tool with which you can collect all the expenses you make while you can also watch your budget. You should always be able to do this, thats why i chose JME.

Wallets can be sent as .csv (comma-separated values) via bluetooth for further processing (MS Excel etc.).
